Using the grocery store dataset (store_data.csv), create plots with appropriate labeling, colors and size to communicate the results of the following questions.

Which store has the highest total sales for the last month?
Which store makes the most sales on average?
Which store sells the most during the week of March 13th, 2016?
Which store has the most sales in the latest 3-month period?

SOLUTION
# imports and load data
import pandas as pd
% matplotlib inline
df = pd.read_csv('store_data.csv')
df.head()
# explore data
df.tail(20)
# sales for the last month
df.iloc[196:,1:].sum().plot(kind='bar');
# average sales
df.mean().plot(kind='pie');
# sales for the week of March 13th, 2016
sales = df[df['week'] == '2016-03-13']
sales.iloc[0,1:].plot(kind='bar')
# sales for the lastest 3-month periods
last_three_months = df[df['week'] == '2017-12-1']
last_three_months.iloc[:,1:].sum().plot(kind='pi
